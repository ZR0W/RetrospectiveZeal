        Even for a project like this, Tabs Immortalized is still on the sillier end of things.
        I often have many browser tabs open on my computer at any time. The way I use them is similar to how I would use sticky notes:
        As a temporary space to remind myself of topics that, while not important enough to put on a calendar or a notebook, I would like to remember nonetheless.
        So here we are. In an attempt to clean up my browser tabs and also to stick with the theme of providing a living space for emphemeral thoughts, here we have Tabs Immortalized.

                This is a mange/now anime show about some high school kids doing homework. There seems to be a lot of cool thematics
                First of all, it's about Jazz music, which I absolutely adore.
                Also the two guys in the show seem to have this quite nerd guy and popular good looking jock dynamic that I'm interested in seeing how it plays out.
                I'd have to rewatch the trailer to recall all my thought at the moment but I hope this is enough of a note for myself to deem this worthy of revisiting.

            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blaise+pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> and his work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pens%C3%A9es">Pensées</a>
            <p>
                There are man cases I could list of famous mathematicians having strong religious beliefs (e.g., Newton). Recently, French mathematician Pascal has joined that list.
                I came across this quote of Pascal's from his book Pensées, which reads: <br>
                <i style="margin-left: 40px;">All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.</i>
                <br>
                Given the topics of discipline and gaining the ability to focus on tasks that recently meander my mind,
                I thought Pensées a book worthy of visiting
                (add it to the list of other scientific essay collections that peak my interest, such as <i><a href="https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">A Mathematician's Lament</a></i>).
                In my preliminary research of the book, I was surprised to find it a "defense of the Christian religion"(Wikipedia).
                <br>
                Though I'm certain this understanding is a shallow one and it would a book worthy of my time.

                As a studying Jazz musician, it is easy for me to feel self riotously about Jazz being this uniquely improvisational genre.
                However, improvisation has roots in more classical genres as well.
                Partimento being this practise where musicians would use a bass line as a grounding sketch upon which to improvise.
                In my journey to improve my classical repertoire, this would also be a topic of great interest.

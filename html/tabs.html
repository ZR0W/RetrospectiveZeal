        Even for a project like this, Tabs Immortalized is still on the sillier end of things.
        I often have many browser tabs open on my computer at any time. The way I use them is similar to how I would use sticky notes:
        As a temporary space to remind myself of topics that, while not important enough to put on a calendar or a notebook, I would like to remember nonetheless.
        So here we are. In an attempt to clean up my browser tabs and also to stick with the theme of providing a living space for emphemeral thoughts, here we have Tabs Immortalized.

                This is a mange/now anime show about some high school kids doing homework. There seems to be a lot of cool thematics
                First of all, it's about Jazz music, which I absolutely adore.
                Also the two guys in the show seem to have this quite nerd guy and popular good looking jock dynamic that I'm interested in seeing how it plays out.
                I'd have to rewatch the trailer to recall all my thought at the moment but I hope this is enough of a note for myself to deem this worthy of revisiting.

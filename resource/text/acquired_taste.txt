One stray night, whilst grocery shopping, as I browse the liqueur section, a bottle of Compari caught my attention. I had long heard good things about how the Negroni is a classic cocktail worth trying. The most unique ingredient for it is Compari which seemed like a pricey investment I wouldn't get much use out of. But tonight it caught my attention for one reason or another, it has now joined my collection.

The taste of the Negroni is, certainly interesting. I know of frequent wine drinker have their own set of terminology for describing idiosyncratic tastes of wine which doesn't naturally find its way into ones vocabulary. Similarly, I will struggle to accurately describe the Negroni's taste so bare with me: Herbal. Medicine-like. I know it has often been described as bitter but my mind did not immediately concur with that review. But that is beside the point.

In an attempt to find out more about this new cocktail I have dove into (and also to make sure I made the drink as intended becuase part of me did think "this can't be right. Right?"), I have been lead to a corner of reddit of another person asking a similar question about the bizarre taste of the Negroni. In the comments of that post, I came across the phrase "Acquired Taste".

I of course know that this phrase exists, in the sense that it was not foreign and I understood what it meant. But I had never incorporated it into my regular vocabulary. Now, it just might be my favorite phrase for describing a very peculiar phenomenon of this sorts.

There is a certain poetic-ness to an acquired taste, don't you think?

It is especially interesting that I come to read this story, right after my internal discussion about the existence of theme in stories as inspired by my reading of confession of a shinagawa monkey. Where as with the later, the theme and moral was teetering on the tip of my tongue, elusive as it was captivating, the theme of carnaval seem to obvious, which, surprisingly, prompts just as much thought as the inability to capture a story's theme.

Dont' judge a book by it's cover. At a glance, this age old adage seems to be the one at the heart of this story. A bit bland if you ask me. A wonderful message, and a tremendously captivating path the story took to convey this. But I just wasn't expecting Murakami to write a story of such a simple message.

Or did he? Is there something more beyond "there is a duality to every being"?
